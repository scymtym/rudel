** TODO Allow users to insert comments
   + Component :: multiple components affected
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   It should be possible to start a threaded comment discussion at any
   point of a document. The comments should not be part of the buffer
   content.
** NEW Handle messages spanning multiple frames
   + Component :: beep-transport
   + Type :: defect
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
** NEW Operation log can grow beyond all bounds (#37)
   + Component :: obby-general
   + Type :: defect
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   When no remote operations are received, the log of local operation
   is not reset and therefore grows beyond all bounds.
** NEW Terminating sessions does not work (#47)
   + Component :: rudel-general
   + Type :: defect
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   There is a menu entry for terminating sessions which are hosted by
   Rudel, but it does not do anything.

   + Component :: obby-client
   + Type :: defect
   + Reporter :: jan

   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan

** TODO Synchronize object graphs
   + Component :: ?
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   Extend protocols to allow synchronizing graph- (or just tree-) like
   data structures like XML or Emacs Lisp objects.
** TODO Notification mechanism
   + Component :: user-interface
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
** TODO Show cursor positions of other users (#5)
   + Component :: rudel-user-interface

** TODO Some kind of server log buffer (#11)
   + Component :: rudel-general
   + Type :: enhancement
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   It would be nice to log server events. This could be done in a
   separate buffer or using a dedicated mechanism like
   rudel-notification.
** TODO Backends should be able to offer additional menu items (#14)
   + Component :: rudel-general
   + Type :: enhancement
   + Reporter :: jan

** TODO Obby users can protect their accounts with passwords (#16)
   + Component :: obby-general
   + Type :: enhancement
   + Reporter :: jan

   The Gobby implementation is in obby/inc/server_buffer.hpp:851
** TODO Zeroconf session notification (#52)
   + Component :: zeroconf
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   Watch interesting Zeroconf services and use `rudel-notify` if new
   services are discovered
** TODO State machine diagram (#59)

** TODO State machine diagram (#60)

** TODO Send key presses as chat messages (#61)
   + Component :: rudel-general
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: Jan
   + Assigned ::
   Sending key presses as chat messages could be really useful for
   somebody something using rudel.
** STARTED Reference manual (#46)
   + Component :: documentation
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned :: jan
   In addition to the `README`, a proper reference manual would be
   nice. At some point, complete info documentation may be
   desirable. Docbook seems to be the best approach since we get (at
   least):
   + Pdf
   + Html
   + Info

** TODO Only read color hue, not complete colors (#53)
   + Component :: rudel-user-interface
   + Type :: enhancement
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   Taking control over saturation and value away from the user makes
   it impossible to choose unreadable colors.

** NEW Zeroconf needs some time before it works
   + Component :: zeroconf
   + Type :: defect
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   When requiring the Zeroconf backend and immediately asking for
   discovered sessions, none are returned, even if there are
   some. Retrying later returns these sessions.
** NEW Get rid of error calls in the server (#58)
   + Component :: obby-backend
   + Type :: defect
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   It makes no sense to call `error` when something goes wrong in
   server code that is called from the process filter. Instead, we
   should try to recover.
** NEW Global mode line publish state mode does not work for all new buffers (#55)
   + Component :: rudel-user-interface
   + Type :: defect
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   `global-mode-line-publish-state-mode` is define using
   `define-globalized-mode`. This seems to only enabled the associated
   minor mode for buffers create by `find-file` and after major mode
   changes. The minor mode is not activated for buffers create by
   `create-buffer`. Since this is used when subscribing to documents,
   this is a problem.
** NEW Handle net6_encryption_info messages (#57)
   + Component :: obby-backend
   + Type :: defect
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
** FIXED Connection resets are not handled properly with transports
   + Component :: multiple components
   + Type :: defect
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   The current session used to be terminated when the connection
   dropped. This does not work when using transports.
